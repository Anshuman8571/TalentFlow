```

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Components** trigger actions through user interactions
2. **React Query** manages server state and API calls
3. **MSW** intercepts API calls and provides mock responses
4. **Dexie.js** handles local data persistence in IndexedDB
5. **Zustand** manages global application state
6. **Components** re-render based on state changes

### API Design
The application uses a RESTful API design pattern with the following endpoints:
- `GET /api/jobs` - Fetch jobs with pagination and filtering
- `GET /api/jobs/:id` - Fetch single job details
- `POST /api/jobs` - Create new job
- `PUT /api/jobs/:id` - Update job
- `DELETE /api/jobs/:id` - Delete job
- `GET /api/candidates` - Fetch candidates with filtering
- `GET /api/candidates/:id` - Fetch single candidate
- `PUT /api/candidates/:id` - Update candidate status

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** (v8 or higher) or **yarn**
- Modern web browser with ES6+ support

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/talentflow.git
   cd talentflow
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open the application**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App (irreversible)

## 🔧 Technical Decisions & Rationale

### 1. TypeScript Implementation
**Decision**: Full TypeScript adoption with strict type checking
**Rationale**: 
- Provides compile-time error detection
- Improves code maintainability and developer experience
- Enables better IDE support and refactoring capabilities
- Reduces runtime errors in production

### 2. Mock Service Worker (MSW)
**Decision**: Use MSW for API mocking instead of a real backend
**Rationale**:
- Enables rapid prototyping without backend dependencies
- Provides realistic API behavior during development
- Allows for comprehensive testing scenarios
- Easy transition to real API endpoints

### 3. Material-UI (MUI) Component Library
**Decision**: Adopt MUI as the primary UI component library
**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive set of pre-built, accessible components
- Consistent design system and theming capabilities
- Strong TypeScript support
- Active community and regular updates

### 4. TanStack React Query
**Decision**: Use React Query for server state management
**Rationale**:
- Excellent caching and synchronization capabilities
- Built-in loading and error states
- Optimistic updates and background refetching
- Reduces boilerplate code for API interactions

### 5. Zustand for Global State
**Decision**: Choose Zustand over Redux or Context API
**Rationale**:
- Minimal boilerplate and simple API
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Small bundle size
- Easy to test and debug

### 6. Dexie.js for Local Storage
**Decision**: Use Dexie.js wrapper for IndexedDB
**Rationale**:
- Provides structured data storage in the browser
- Better performance than localStorage for large datasets
- Supports complex queries and indexing
- Maintains data persistence across sessions

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Issues
1. **Performance**: Large candidate lists may experience rendering delays
   - **Mitigation**: Implement virtualization for large lists
   - **Status**: Planned for future release

2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Some dashboard components need mobile optimization
   - **Mitigation**: Responsive design improvements in progress
   - **Status**: Partially addressed

3. **Real-time Updates**: No real-time synchronization between multiple users
   - **Mitigation**: Implement WebSocket connections in future versions
   - **Status**: Future enhancement

### Technical Debt
1. **Test Coverage**: Current test coverage is minimal
   - **Plan**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
   - **Priority**: High

2. **Error Boundaries**: Limited error boundary implementation
   - **Plan**: Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
   - **Priority**: Medium

3. **Accessibility**: Some components need ARIA improvements
   - **Plan**: Conduct accessibility audit and implement fixes
   - **Priority**: Medium
